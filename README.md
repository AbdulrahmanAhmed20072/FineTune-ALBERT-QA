# FineTune-ALBERT-QA
This project fine-tunes ALBERT for Question Answering (QA) using LoRA and BitsAndBytes quantization. It processes text data, tokenizes questions and contexts, applies efficient fine-tuning techniques, and trains a Transformer model to extract precise answers from given contexts.
